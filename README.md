# IT3040 Assignment 1 – Thanglish to Tamil Converter Testing (Option 2)

This repository contains automated functional and UI tests for the real-time Thanglish (Romanized Tamil) to Tamil script converter at https://tamil.changathi.com/.

The tests are built using **Playwright** (for browser automation) and **pytest** (for test execution and reporting).  
- 24 positive scenarios (correct conversions)  
- 10 negative scenarios (failures / incorrect behavior)  
- 1 UI scenario (real-time output update)  

All scenarios cover the required categories: sentence structures, grammatical forms, input lengths (S/M/L), mixed English, slang, punctuation, formatting, etc. (as per assignment tasks).
